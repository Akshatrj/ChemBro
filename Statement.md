**Problem Statement**

Students often struggle to understand atomic structure, electron configurations, and periodic table concepts using static textbook diagrams. The lack of an interactive visualization tool makes it difficult to connect theoretical knowledge with real-time representation.
This project solves that problem by providing a Python-based application that generates electron shell diagrams, displays element information, and visually supports learning the periodic table.

**Scope of the Project**

    Visualize electron distribution across shells for any element (1–118).

    Display complete atom details including name, symbol, atomic mass, block, density, melting/boiling point, etc.

    Provide an interactive interface for entering atomic numbers.

    Generate animated diagrams using Python Turtle graphics.

    Serve as a learning tool for students and educators.

**Target Users**

    School & college students learning chemistry

    Teachers demonstrating atomic structure

    Science enthusiasts exploring elements

    Developers interested in Python visualization

    Learners preparing presentations or projects


**High-Level Features**

    Electron Shell Diagram Generator
    Automatically draws K, L, M, N, O, P, and Q shells with correct electron placement.

    118-Element Database
    Includes detailed information for every chemical element.

    Interactive Input Handling
    User enters atomic number; program auto-processes details.

**Graphical Visualization**
Animated turtle graphics show electrons orbiting the nucleus.

**User-Friendly Architecture**
Modular, readable code—ideal for academic projects.
